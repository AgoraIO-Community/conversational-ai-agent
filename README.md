# conversational-ai-agent

This git repository contains a front-end example of a web application that connects users with a conversational AI using Agora's real-time communication technology.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a user interface for interacting with an AI agent through voice communication. It utilizes Agora's SDK to handle the audio streaming between the user and the AI.

## Important Note

This project focuses on the front-end implementation and assumes that you have already built your own backend service for connecting the Agora audio stream to your AI model. The backend implementation is not included in this repository.

## Running the Front-end

To run the front-end code:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder in your terminal.
2. Follow the setup instructions in the frontend's README file.
